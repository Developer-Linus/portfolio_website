# Theory
## Dimensions
- allow us to define the space surrounding us.
- Types:
1. Zeroth dimension (OD)—a point without dimension.
2. First dimension (1D)—a line with no width and height.
3. Second dimension(2D)—shape with length and width with no depth.
4. Third dimension (3D)—shape with lenght, width, and height. These three gives a volume.
5. Fourth dimension (4D)—This is time. Used alongside length, width, and height.

# What is Three.js?
- It is a JavaScript library and an API built on top of WebGL enabling us to create 3D graphics.
- Three.js enable us to create environment and scene where we can create interactions for our 3D objects.
- We should not confuse `scene` and `environment`. The Scene is the overall container while environment is the surrounding 
atmosphere or backdrop within the scene. 
- We make a scene our own world with the help of `objects`.
- Objects are the building blocks of a 3D scene.
- Once we have objects in our scene, we have to make them interactive. This is where the concept of `animations` come in.
- `Animations` involve transforming objects' positions or change its size or angle through rotation.
- To make animations even more realistic, Three.js allows us to add `shadows` and `lights`.
- In 3D world, we have `cameras` that act as our eyes in the real-world.
- Cameras in 3D scene decide parts the user will see in the scene.
> Now the question is, what we do with the information that our eyes give us?
- They are passed to our brains for processing.
- `Renderer` is the brain in Three.js.
- It processes everything defined to produce the output.
